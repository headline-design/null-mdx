Design engineering is more than just making things look pretty; it's about the deep technical implementation of high-fidelity user experiences. 

## High-Fidelity UI

Gone are the days of static mockups. Today, we build:
- **Kinetic Interfaces**: UI that moves with natural physics.
- **Glassmorphism**: Layered, translucent elements that provide depth.
- **Dynamic Theming**: Color systems that adapt to content.

Our design system, Null MDX, is built on these principles.
