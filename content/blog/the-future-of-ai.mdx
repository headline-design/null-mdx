The world of software development is shifting from assisted automation to full-blown agentic workflows. In this article, we explore how we use advanced LLMs to not just suggest code, but to reason through complex system architectures.

## The Rise of Agents

Agents aren't just chatbots; they are systems that can:
1. **Perceive** the state of a codebase.
2. **Plan** a multi-step execution strategy.
3. **Execute** tool-based actions to achieve a goal.

We believe this is the future of productivity for engineers.
