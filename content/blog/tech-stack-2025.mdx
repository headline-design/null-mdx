Stability and speed are the two pillars of our tech stack. As we head into 2025, we've solidified our choices around technologies that provide both.

## Core Frameworks

1. **Next.js**: For the best developer experience and performance.
2. **Tailwind CSS**: For rapid, consistent styling.
3. **Lucide React**: For a beautiful and lightweight icon system.

We also rely heavily on MDX for content-driven pages, allowing us to treat documentation as code.
