## Welcome

This is my first blog post! I'm excited to share my thoughts on software development, design, and building products.

## What I'll Write About

I plan to cover topics like:

- **Web Development** - Modern frameworks, best practices, and tools
- **Design Systems** - Building consistent, scalable UI components
- **Developer Experience** - Improving workflows and productivity
- **Product Building** - Lessons learned from shipping software

## The Tech Stack

This blog is built with:

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX components
- **Supabase Storage** - Image and asset hosting
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling

<Callout type="info">
  This is an example of a custom callout component that you can use in your MDX content.
</Callout>

## Code Examples

Here's a simple React component:

```tsx
function HelloWorld({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
}
```

## What's Next

Stay tuned for more posts. I'll be sharing tutorials, insights, and lessons learned from my journey as a developer.

Thanks for reading!
