Null MDX provides full support for MDX, allowing you to use React components directly in your markdown files.

## Components

You can use any of our built-in components like `<Callout />` or `<Steps />` to structure your content.

```tsx
<Callout>
  This is a callout component!
</Callout>
```

## Syntax Highlighting

We use `rehype-pretty-code` for high-quality syntax highlighting and code block features.
