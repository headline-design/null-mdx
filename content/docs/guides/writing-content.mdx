## Writing Content

Content is written in MDX format, which combines Markdown with React components.

### File Structure

- Blog posts go in `content/blog/`
- Documentation goes in `content/docs/`

### Frontmatter

Each MDX file starts with frontmatter:

\`\`\`yaml
---
title: "My Post Title"
description: "A brief description"
date: "2024-12-22"
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
draft: false
order: 1  # for docs only
---
\`\`\`

### Using Images

Reference images from Supabase Storage:

\`\`\`markdown
![Alt text](path/to/image.jpg)
\`\`\`

The image path is relative to your Supabase bucket.

### Custom Components

Use the Callout component for important information:

\`\`\`mdx
<Callout type="info">
  This is helpful information.
</Callout>
\`\`\`

Available types: `info`, `warning`, `error`, `success`

<Callout type="success">
  Your content will automatically be styled with beautiful typography.
</Callout>

### Code Blocks

Use fenced code blocks with language hints:

\`\`\``markdown
\`\`\`typescript
const greeting = "Hello, World!"
\`\`\`
